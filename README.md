# CGA Programming Assignment #2
Sprite Animation<br><br>

Requirements list: (Priority)
<ul>
<li> Provide a background. (1)
<li> Start with Wire Sponge doing his intro animation. (2)
<li> Allow the user to control Wire Sponge. Wire Sponge can do the following actions:
   <ul>
<<<<<<< HEAD
   <li>(1) Spin chain. This can only be done when Wire Sponge is on the ground.
      <ul>
      <li>(2) Wire Sponge spins his chain in front of him for a few seconds.
      </ul>
   <li>(1) Leap. Wire Sponge leaps in the direction he is facing. 
   <li>(1) Throw chain horizontally. This can be done when Wire Sponge is on the ground, or while Wire Sponge is in the middle of a leap.
      <ul>
      <li>(2) Wire Sponge throws his chain horizontally. 
      <li>(2) The chain has limited range. If the chain does not hit a wall, the chain retracts back to Wire Sponge.
      <li>(2) If the chain hits a wall, Wire Sponge pulls himself to the wall.
      </ul>
   <li>(1) Throw chain vertically. This can only be done if Wire Sponge is on the ground.
      <ul>
      <li>(2) Wire Sponge throws his chain upwards
      <li>(2) When the chain hits the ceiling, Wire Sponge will pull himself up to the ceiling.
      <li>(2) Somewhere in the middle, Wire Sponge stops temporarily and throws a seed.
      <li>(2) The seed is thrown with a random upwards elevation and travels in a parabolic path.
      <li>(2) If the seed hits the ceiling, it will bounce off the ceiling.
      <li>(2) If the seed hits the floor, a vine will grow vertically out of it.
      <li>(2) If the seed hits a wall, a vine will grow horizontally out of it.
      <li>(2) The vine disappears after some time (10-15 seconds).
      <li>(2) After throwing the seed, Wire Sponge continues pulling himself upwards.
      <li>(2) After reaching the ceiling, Wire Sponge descends to the the ground.
      <li>(3) Wire Sponge can shoot seeds multiple times on his way up.
      <li>(3) The vines point to the location of the Megaman dummy (which will be explained later).
      </ul>
   <li>(1) Change facing direction
   <li>(1) Thunder dance. This can only be done if Wire Sponge is on the ground.
      <ul>
      <li>(2) Wire Sponge turns red (or orange), puffs out some steam from his head, and turns back green. The tip of his head becomes some kind of lightning conductor.
      <li>(2) He then performs some kind of dance animation.
      <li>(2) After performing the dance animation, lightning bolts appear randomly.
      <li>(3) Wire Sponge gradually turns red from bottom to top.
      </ul>
   <li>(1) Place a dummy, doll, or puppet of Megaman (or anything else that you like) as a target for Wire Sponge. 
      <ul>
      <li>(2) The dummy starts at a fixed location on the ground. 
      <li>(2) The dummy is by default passive. It does not perform any action.
         <ul>
         <li>(3) The dummy is able to move around. You decide how the dummy moves around.
         <li>(3) The dummy can shoot projectiles. You decide how the projectiles move.
         <li>(3) If Wire Sponge gets hit by a projectile shot by the dummy, he staggers back.
         <li>(3) If Wire Sponge gets hit by a projectile while he is spinning his chain, the projectile will be deflected instead.
         </ul>
      <li>(1) If the dummy gets hit by Wire Sponge, his chain, or his projectiles (seeds, vines, lightning), the dummy will disappear.
         <ul>
         <li>(2) After a few seconds, it will respawn at a random location floating on the water.
         <li>(2) The dummy must not collide with Wire Sponge when it respawns.
         <li>(3) Display an animation of the dummy getting destroyed.v
         <li>(3) Display an animation of the dummy getiing electrocuted when hit by lightning.
         </ul>
      </ul>
   </ul>
<li>(2) Use the proper animations
